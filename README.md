## Linear combination

- Let u = (u1, ..., uk) ∈ V
k be a list of size k, containing vectors (V is a vector space).

- Let λ = (λ1, ..., λk) ∈ K
k be a list of size k, containing scalars

A linear combination of a set of vectors u1, u2, ..., uk with coefficients λ1, λ2, ..., λk 
is the sum of each vector scaled by its corresponding coefficient:

    λ1 ⋅ u1 + λ2 ⋅ u2 + ⋯ + λk ⋅ uk

Example:

Given:

    u1 = (1, 2, 3),  
    u2 = (0, 10, -100)  

And coefficients:

    λ1 = 10,  
    λ2 = -2  

We multiply each vector by its scalar:

    10 ⋅ u1 = (10 ⋅ 1, 10 ⋅ 2, 10 ⋅ 3) = (10, 20, 30)  

    -2 ⋅ u2 = (-2 ⋅ 0, -2 ⋅ 10, -2 ⋅ (-100)) = (0, -20, 200)  

Adding the results:

    (10, 20, 30) + (0, -20, 200) = (10, 0, 230)
